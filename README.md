What do we want?

We want to be able to post updates (like "next meeting" and "meeting notes")

categories like

* Home screen (we'll post upcoming events)
* Past events (text, photos, audio could go here. could have a photo gallery here too from events)
* Lounge notes (where we can also include links to audio or even embed audio maybe?)
* Press Coverage (links and stubs of stories)
* Contact/Questions: (dclisteninglounge@gmail.com)
* suggested listening/DCLL audio library (where group members can post suggested audio clips)
* forum (in an ideal world we'd someone link between this space and the DCLL Facebook/twitter feed-- can we pull in content from either and have it land here?)
